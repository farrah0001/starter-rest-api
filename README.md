The thesis works together on the basis of the following three important pillars:

- Serverless Application (AWS) Code on GitHub:
https://github.com/FarrahZakir/thesis

- CI/CD Pipeline Using CircleCI:
https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/FarrahZakir/thesis

- Serverless Deployment Using Cyclic:
https://thesis.cyclic.app

# Reference
This application code is based on the sample application "Starter REST Api" available from Cyclic at: https://github.com/cyclic-software/starter-rest-api  

The CircleCI configuration file is based on the project-specific auto-generated configuration file from CircleCI.
